# Git Ideas 

## Description

Git Ideas is an app that allows the user to search GitHub for project inspiration. Users can search GitHub repositories by keyword, and search results can be annotated and saved into a user's personal library. Users can create unique tags (e.g., Project 1) to further organize their library. All saved items can be further edited or deleted once in the user's library. The user's library and all associated tags and comments are password protected, and the user must be logged in to access the app's functionality.
